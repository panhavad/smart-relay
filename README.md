### Purpose
Smart relay project is mainly being as a simple switch with can be work on it own base on temperature condition that set by user. This is initial will connect to a water pump in a hytroponic farm which will taking care of a farm temperature. It will try to maintaince temperature of that farm in a certain temperature level that set by user.
